  <p class="mb-4">Welcome to Quaks, hosted on quaks.ai (the "Website" or "Service"), a personal finance study project developed and hosted by Bruno Sant'Anna ("I," "me," or "the Developer"), an individual developer based in the Netherlands, European Union. This Website provides tools for generating finance charts, technical indicators (such as RSI, MACD, and others), and AI-agentic technical analysis and simulations. The underlying open-source code for this project is released under the MIT License and is available on GitHub at bsantanna/quant-agents.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">This Service is experimental in nature and is powered by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including but not limited to machine learning models for analysis, simulation, and data processing. By accessing or using the Website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Description of the Service</h2>
