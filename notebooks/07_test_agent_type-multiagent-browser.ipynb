Now I can rewrite this first paragraph in a way that a 12-year-old would understand:\n\n**Here's the simplified version:**\n\n**Mathematical finance** (also called quantitative finance or financial mathematics) is basically using math to help solve money problems. It's when smart people use numbers and calculations to figure out things about money and investing. There are two main ways people use this math with money: \n\n1. First, they use it to figure out how much certain financial products (called derivatives) should cost\n2. Second, they use it to help people manage risk (which means avoiding losing money) and decide how to invest their money wisely\n\nThink of it like this: just like you might use math to figure out if you have enough allowance money to buy something you want, financial mathematicians use much more complicated math to help banks, companies, and investors make smart decisions with much larger amounts of money!"
