## What is Agent-Lab?

Agent-Lab is a robust toolkit engineered for the development and thorough testing of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It offers key features designed to streamline the process, including a REST API for managing interactions, relational persistence with PostgreSQL for data storage, and secure secrets management using Vault. In addition, Agent-Lab emphasizes observability through OpenTelemetry for detailed insights and leverages PgVector for effective vector storage and search, ultimately providing a comprehensive platform for building and evaluating LLM-powered agents.

---

## Project Principles

- Support researchers and developers with a comprehensive toolkit for developing, testing, and experimenting with LLM agents, including example implementations.
- Provide an MCP server interface for agent discovery, dialog history, and agent-to-agent communication.
- Offer integration testing support to ensure quality assurance.
- Deliver observability for responsible AI explainability and agent evaluation.
- Leverage a cloud-native architecture for seamless deployment and scalability.

---

## Key Features

- **REST API**: Manage integrations with AI suppliers, LLMs settings, agents, and conversation histories with our [REST API](doc/REST_API.md).
- **MCP Server**: Utilize the [Model Control Protocol (MCP) server](doc/MCP.md) for agent discovery, dialog history, and agent-to-agent communication.
- **Observability**: Obtain detailed insights through logs, metrics, and traces powered by [OpenTelemetry](doc/OTEL.md).
  - Includes reference implementations for [Grafana](doc/otel/GRAFANA.md) and [OpenSearch Dashboards](doc/otel/OPENSEARCH.md).
- **Cloud-Native**: Optimized for cloud environments with Docker, Kubernetes, and [Helm charts](doc/CHARTS.md) for streamlined deployment.
- **Relational Persistence**: Store data reliably using PostgreSQL to support the [entity domain model](doc/DOMAIN.md) for prompts, agent-specific settings, conversations, and more.
- **Secrets Management**: Securely store and retrieve secrets with [Vault](doc/VAULT.md).
- **Vector Storage and Search**: Efficiently manage vector data using PgVector for similarity search and retrieval.
- **Agent Memory**: Using PostgreSQL checkpointer to store and retrieve agent memory, enabling agents to maintain context across interactions.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure reliability and correctness with a comprehensive [integration test suite](doc/TESTS.md).

## MCP Server

Agent-Lab features a MCP Server that allows agent discovery (`get_agent_list` tool), dialog history (`get_message_list` tool) and agent-to-agent communication (`post_message` tool).

The following example shows MCP Server discovering and obtaining dialog history of a [supervised coder agent](/notebooks/05_test_agent_type-multiagent-coder.ipynb) instance:

## Getting Started

Agent-Lab is designed for ease of setup and use, whether you're a developer building LLM agents or a researcher experimenting with agentic workflows.

Documentation in this repository is divided into two main sections:

- **Developer's Guide**: Tailored for developers who want to customize Agent-Lab or build agentic workflows. It includes setup instructions and development practices. Please refer to our [developer's guide](doc/DEV_GUIDE.md).
- **Researcher's Guide**: Provides detailed instructions for researchers on setting up and using Agent-Lab, including how to run the MCP server, manage agents, conduct experiments, tune prompts, and prototype new agents. Please refer to our [researcher's guide](doc/RESEARCHER_GUIDE.md).

Please consult these guides for detailed instructions on getting started with Agent-Lab.
